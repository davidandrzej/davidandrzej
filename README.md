## David M. Andrzejewski

* ðŸŒ‰ I am a machine learning and software engineering enthusiast living in the San Francisco Bay Area.
* ðŸ¤– I am especially interested in applied settings where we can augment or amplify human expertise with machine learning.
* ðŸªµ At [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/), I work on helping organizations use machine-generated data to ensure the reliability and security of their software. 
* In the pre-COVID days I had also co-organized a popular (> 7500 members, > 18k Twitter followers) [San Francisco Bay Area Machine Learning meetup](https://www.meetup.com/sf-bayarea-machine-learning/).
* Before _all that_, I had been a postdoctoral researcher at [LLNL](https://www.llnl.gov/) and a PhD student at the [University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/).
